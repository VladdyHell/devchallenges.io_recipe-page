        <h2>instructions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat
    oven to 350Â°F (177&deg;C)</li>
            <li>Make the crust: Using a food processor, pulse the graham
    Crackers into crumbs. Pour intoa medium bowl and stir in sugar
    and melted butter until combined. (You can also pulse it all
    together in the food processor,) Mixture will be sandy. Press firmly
    into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a 9-inch or 10-inch
    springform pan. No need to grease the pan first. I use the bottom
    of a measuring cup to pack the crust down tightly. Pre-bake for8
    minutes. Remove from the oven and place the hot pan on a large
    piece of aluminum foil. The foil will wrap around the pan for the
    water bath in step4. Allow crust to slightly cool as you prepare
    the filling.</li>
            <li>Make the filling: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a
    paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar
    together on medium-high speed in a large boWl until the mixture
    is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream,
    vanilla extract, and lemon juice then beat until fully combined. on
    medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating after each
    addition until just blended. After the final egg is incorporated into
    the batter, stop mixing. 1o heip prevent the cheesecake trom
    deflating and cracking as it cools, avoid over-mixing the batter as
    best you can.</li>
            <li>Prepare the simple water bath (see note) Boil a pot of water.
    You need 1 inch of water in your roasting pan for the water bath,
    so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of hot water.
    As the water is heating up, wrap the aluminum foil around the
    springform pan. Pour the cheesecake batter on top of the crust.
    Use a rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an even layer.
    Place the pan inside of a large roasting pan. Carefuly pour the
    hot water inside of the pan and place in the oven. (Or you can
    place the roasting pan in the oven first, then pour the hot water
    in. whichever is easier for you.)</li>
            <li>Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost
    set. When it's done, the center of the cheesecake will slightly
    wobble if you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open
    the oven door slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in the
    water bath as it cools down forl hour. Remove from the oven and
    water bath, then cool cheesecake completely at room
    temperature. Then refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours
    or overnight.</li>
            <li>Usea knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the
    springform pan, then remove the rim. Using a clean sharp knife,
    cut into slices for serving. For neat slices, wipe the knife clean and
    dip into warm water between each slice.</li>
            <li>Serve cheesecake with desired toppings. Cover and store leftover
    cheesecake in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li>
